# Knight Owl

> Simple things should be simple, and difficult things should be possible.

Crafting tools and systems that help creators think, write, and build
with structure and intent.

**By developers, for creators:**

> Respect your user's time. Every workaround we skip in the
> infrastructure is a hoop the user has to jump through. Do the long,
> proper thing once so users get a zero-friction experience. No hacks,
> no "just run this extra command", no documented workarounds for
> problems we can solve upstream. If a fix requires the user to act,
> the real fix hasn't shipped yet.
