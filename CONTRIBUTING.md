# Contributing to Knight Owl Projects

> Respect your user's time. Every workaround we skip in the

This philosophy applies to every repository in the organization. When
contributing, keep it in mind:

- **No hacks.** If a solution requires the user to run an extra command,
  add a flag, or read a workaround — the real fix hasn't shipped yet.
- **No documented workarounds.** Documentation is not a substitute for
  solving the problem upstream.
- **Do it once, do it right.** The long way done properly is shorter
  than the shortcut done twice.

## Getting Started

Each repository has its own README with setup instructions and a
`make help` target. Start there.
